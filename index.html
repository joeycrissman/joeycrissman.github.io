			<p>My name is Joseph Louis Crissman, and I am a proud senior at Armstrong Jr.Sr high school, home of the River hawks. Before Armstrong,
			I went to Kittanning high school, home of the Wildcats. I go to my current school now because of the merger between Ford city, home of
			the Sabers, and Kittanning. Since I was in the third grade, I have been playing football from the Indians to the River hawks. I absolutely 
			love the sport of football. The reason I do is because how unpredictable in can be. You could be the best team in the nation, but if you don't prepare
			correctly and efficiently, you could lose. For ten years I have been playing football and throughout those ten years, I've seen people come and go, but 
			the first time I really had to experience that was my freshmen year. The fact that I would never play with the seniors again hit me like a brick. Now, my
			last year of football ever has passed, and when it did, the first question I asked my self was; what now? I'm just glad that I had an answer for that. As
			of recently, I got accepted to Indiana University of Pennsylvania for communications in media, and met some the greatest people along the way. Hayley Woodside
            is one of them and she is one of the most amazing people I have ever met. She is the main reason I decided to get into the field of film. Mr. Swanson,
			my teacher/mentor taught me every thing I know about filming and editing. It was because of him that I was able to work on an actual independent film 
			called "A Wish For Giants" as a production assistant. He also let me work on his music video forest queen. One of my other good filming friends is Noah Crissman.
			There is never a dull moment with him. A few weeks ago, I helped him with his short horror film "Welcome home" and it turned out amazing. The month of November
			was a very stressful one. I had a three filming projects that were due by the end of the month, plus I was still depressed about football coming to an end.
			The one filming project was the Harlem Wizards versus the Armstrong All stars game. The game itself is at least two hours long and editing it took me twenty-five
			hours to finish. One project my group and had to do was a documentary. We decided to do it on an local urban legend called ""Rubens Grave". Its about this
			teenager who lived in the 1800's that killed a bunch of school children and a school teacher and then hung himself from a tree in a cemetery while riding his 
            white horse	close to ford city. The legend says that if you go to the grave yard at night, you could see a white horse with red glowing eyes on top of a hill side.
			So, what I wanted to do was have a real authentic investigation at the cemetery at night. When we went, we actually got some EVP'S "electronic voice phenomenon".
			The video is on the Armstrong School District Youtube page.
